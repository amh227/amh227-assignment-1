			As far as introductions go... I like cats, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, The Walking Dead, and most low budget Sci-fi movies. Just saw Sharktopus vs. Whalewolf, that was pretty neat. Wrote my first scraper over the summer, that was cool. Hopefully this class will help be perfect it a little more. I love New Orleans and went there for a little summer vaca. I have <font>pink</font> hair. Not really that shade though, a little more <font>magenta-y.</font> That's kinda close, but I can't find it on the bit map.

			<font color="#E90075">magenta-y.</font>
